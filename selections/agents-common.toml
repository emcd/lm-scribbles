This is an exceptional reference document that demonstrates:
- Comprehensive coverage of a complex configuration system
- Clear examples for every configuration option
- Multiple configuration mechanisms (CLI flags, config file, profiles)
- Advanced features like MCP server integration, OpenTelemetry, sandboxing
- Practical examples for Azure, Ollama, and custom providers
- Well-structured with clear hierarchy and cross-references

The document serves as both user documentation and a design pattern reference for
configuration systems. Shows thoughtful design with multiple levels of override
(CLI > profile > config file > defaults) and extensive customization options.

Demonstrates debugging approach for testing the agentsmgr content generation pipeline:
- Loads configuration from YAML profiles
- Tests ContentGenerator instantiation
- Validates generation to temporary directory
- Uses tree command to visualize output structure
- Good error handling with traceback

Shows practical testing pattern for file generation systems and configuration-driven
workflows. Useful for understanding how to debug template/generation systems.

[summary]
selection_insights = """
The agents-common project contains configuration management and testing code.
Selected items represent:
1. High-quality reference documentation (codex-config.md)
2. Practical testing patterns for generation systems (test_generation.py)

Other files in the project include debug scripts and test POCs that were not
selected due to limited context or routine nature.

Look for:
- Comprehensive documentation files that serve as both reference and design patterns
- Test scripts that demonstrate debugging techniques or validation patterns
- Configuration examples that show complex system design
