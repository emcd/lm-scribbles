Exceptional reference document that demonstrates:
- Comprehensive coverage of a complex configuration system
- Clear examples for every configuration option
- Multiple configuration mechanisms (CLI flags, config file, profiles)
- Advanced features like MCP server integration, OpenTelemetry, sandboxing
- Practical examples for Azure, Ollama, and custom providers
- Well-structured with clear hierarchy and cross-references

The document serves as both user documentation and a design pattern reference for
configuration systems. Shows thoughtful design with multiple levels of override
(CLI > profile > config file > defaults) and extensive customization options.

Value: Model for documenting complex configuration systems.
Shows how to provide examples for every option while maintaining clarity.
Demonstrates progressive disclosure with basic to advanced sections.

Demonstrates debugging approach for testing the agentsmgr content generation pipeline:
- Loads configuration from YAML profiles
- Tests ContentGenerator instantiation
- Validates generation to temporary directory
- Uses tree command to visualize output structure
- Good error handling with traceback

Shows practical testing pattern for file generation systems and configuration-driven
workflows. Useful for understanding how to debug template/generation systems.

Value: Template for testing file generation systems.
Shows how to validate generation output using external tools (tree).
Demonstrates configuration-driven testing approach.
