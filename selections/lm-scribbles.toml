Demonstrates practical automation pattern for batch operations:
- Iterates over predefined list of projects
- Checks for scribbles directory existence
- Calls lmscribbles ingest command for each project
- Clean output with section separators

Shows the evolution from discovery (find-projects-to-ingest.sh) to automation.
Useful pattern for batch processing workflows and project management automation.
The script is self-documenting with clear structure and error handling.

Demonstrates valuable discovery/inventory pattern:
- Scans base directory for all projects
- Checks for scribbles subdirectories
- Counts files (excluding .gitignore)
- Identifies already-ingested vs needs-ingestion status
- Clean tabular output

This is the reconnaissance phase that informs the automation script.
Shows good systems thinking: understand what exists before automating.
Useful pattern for project auditing and inventory management.

[summary]
selection_insights = """
The lm-scribbles project contains meta-automation scripts for the scribbles system itself.
Both files were selected (100% selection rate) because they demonstrate:
1. Discovery-then-automate workflow pattern
2. Practical shell scripting for project management
3. Clean, self-documenting code structure

These scripts show the bootstrapping process for the lm-scribbles system and provide
useful patterns for anyone building similar project management automation.
"""

recommendations_for_future = """
Look for:
- Meta-scripts that automate or analyze the development process itself
- Discovery/inventory scripts that understand project structure
- Batch processing automation that follows from discovery
- Clean shell scripts with good error handling and output formatting
